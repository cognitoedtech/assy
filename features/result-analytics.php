							<h3>Result Analytics (Charting) &amp; Question Paper Inspection</h3>
							EZeeAssess's <b><i>Result Analytics (Charting) &amp; Question
									Paper Inspection</i></b> helps you analysing candidate's
							performance by digging deep into every section. With <i><b>&ldquo;Test
									DNA Analysis&rdquo;</b></i> you can get the visual plots via
							charts - that illustrates Candidate&rsquo;s over all performance
							in assessment/test. Not to mention that we understand the
							requirement of PDF export and Test Admin will find that on top
							right which is <i><b>&ldquo;PDF Download&rdquo;</b></i> icon. <br />
							<br /> Okay, but what if you just want to have a glimpse of
							everything for a particular schedule? Well you just have to check
							<i><b>&ldquo;Brief Result&rdquo;</b></i>, navigate and select
							from drop down options, apply filters and get the statistics on
							your fingretips. Isn't that sound wonderfull ! <br /> <br /> We
							are sure you will be looking a place now to check the question
							paper asked during test to analyze and see which question was
							rightly or wrongly attempted by a candidate. Not to worry, <i><b>&ldquo;Result
									Inspection&rdquo;</b></i> empowers you to do exactly that with
							an option to export attempted question paper in PDF file. <br />
							<br /> Challange for Test Admin doesn't end here, as there are
							scenarios when same test has to be conducted on <b>differnt time
								and dates</b>. <b><i>Result consolidation</i></b> and <b><i>merit
									list generation</i></b> is always been a challanging and time
							consuming task, our designers and product team has came up with a
							solution for result consolidation, i.e. <i><b>&ldquo;Produce
									Custom Result&rdquo;</b></i>. It not only helps <b>Test Admin</b>
							to consolidate result but also allows to apply custom filters
							before the generation of final short listing. Now shouldn't you
							say, it's Awesome!
